# Hate Speech Classifier

The classifier.py script can be used to build and train a CNN inspired by Yoon Kim's 2014 paper. The Twitter word
embeddings can be found at the [GloVe project homepage](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) and the hate speech
dataset can be found on Tom Davidson's [personal
repo](https://github.com/t-davidson/hate-speech-and-offensive-language).
